yvalik,

Your account at localhost has been activated.

You may now log in by clicking on this link or copying and pasting it in your  
browser:

http://localhost/mir-pravoslav/?q=user/reset/1/1315205301/0cf4e76f521067fd112b0c1684d369d5

This is a one-time login, so it can be used only once.

After logging in, you will be redirected to  
http://localhost/mir-pravoslav/?q=user/1/edit so you can change your  
password.

Once you have set your own password, you will be able to log in to  
http://localhost/mir-pravoslav/?q=user in the future using:

username: yvalik
